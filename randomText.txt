joker was only by retrospect you could be made aware of the amazing variety of ideas that had been presented mr clare certainly found few men in this remote situation that were capable of participating in his ideas and amusements it has been among the weaknesses of great men to fly to solitude and converse with woods and groves rather than with a circle of strong and comprehensive minds like their own from the moment of mr falkland s arrival in the neighbourhood mr clare distinguished him in the most flattering manner to so penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience and patient observation to discover the merits and defects of any character that presented itself the materials of his judgment had long since been accumulated and at the close of so illustrious a life he might almost be said to see through nature at a glance what wonder that he took some interest in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his own but to mr tyrrel s diseased imagination every distinction bestowed on his neighbour seemed to be expressly intended as an insult to him on the other hand mr clare though gentle and benevolent in his remonstrances to a degree that made the taking offence impossible was by no means parsimonious of praise or slow to make use of the deference that was paid him for the purpose of procuring justice to merit it happened at one of those public meetings at which mr falkland and mr tyrrel were present that the conversation in one of the most numerous sets into which the company was broken turned upon the poetical talents of the former a lady who was present and was distinguished for the acuteness of her understanding said she had been favoured with a sight of a poem he had just written entitled an ode to the genius of chivalry which appeared to her of exquisite merit the curiosity of the company was immediately excited and the lady added she had a copy in her pocket which was much at their service provided its being thus produced would not be disagreeable to the author the whole circle immediately entreated mr falkland to comply with their wishes and mr clare who was one of the company enforced their petition nothing gave this gentleman so much pleasure as to have an opportunity of witnessing and doing justice to the exhibition of intellectual excellence mr falkland had no false modesty or affectation and therefore readily yielded his consent mr tyrrel accidentally sat at the extremity of this circle it cannot be supposed that the turn the conversation had taken was by any means agreeable to him he appeared to wish to withdraw himself but there seemed to be some unknown power that as it were by enchantment retained him in his place and made him consent to drink to the dregs the bitter potion which envy had prepared for him the poem was read to the rest of the company by mr clare whose elocution was scarcely inferior to his other accomplishments simplicity discrimination and energy constantly attended him in the act of reading and it is not easy to conceive a more refined delight than fell to the lot of those who had the good fortune to be his auditors the beauties of mr falkland s poem were accordingly exhibited with every advantage the successive passions of the author were communicated to the hearer what was impetuous and what was solemn were delivered with a responsive feeling and a flowing and unlaboured tone the pictures conjured up by the creative fancy of the poet were placed full to view at one time overwhelming the soul with superstitious awe and at another transporting it with luxuriant beauty the character of the hearers upon this occasion has already been described they were for the most part plain unlettered and of little refinement poetry in general they read when read at all from the mere force of imitation and with few sensations of pleasure but this poem had a peculiar vein of glowing inspiration this very poem would probably have been seen by many of them with little effect but the accents of mr clare carried it home to the heart he ended and as the countenances of his auditors had before sympathised with the passions of the composition so now they emulated each other in declaring their approbation their sensations were of a sort to which they were little accustomed one spoke and another followed by a sort of uncontrollable impulse and the rude and broken manner of their commendations rendered them the more singular and remarkable but what was least to be endured was the behaviour of mr clare he returned the manuscript to the lady from whom he had received it and then addressing mr falkland said with emphasis and animation ha this is as it should be it is of the right stamp i have seen too many hard essays strained from the labour of a pedant and pastoral ditties distressed in lack of a meaning they are such as you sir that we want do not forget however that the muse was not given to add refinements to idleness but for the highest and most invaluable purposes act up to the magnitude of your destiny a moment after mr clare quitted his seat and with mr falkland and two or three more withdrew as soon as they were gone mr tyrrel edged further into the circle he had sat silent so long that he seemed ready to burst with gall and indignation mighty pretty verses said he half talking to himself and not addressing any particular person why ay the verses are well enough damnation i should like to know what a ship load of such stuff is good for why surely said the lady who had introduced mr falkland s ode on the present occasion you must allow that poetry is an
he immediately penetrated the cause and observed that my very countenance told him he was no longer a welcome guest to me i asked him if he ought so to be since his motives for seeking admission were unworthy of being communicated to my friends that he said was not the case but that prudence in the present instance required a temporary concealment he then undertook to exculpate himself from blame assuring me that as soon as i should discountenance the expectations of mr boyer and discontinue the reception of his address his intentions should be made known he was enlarging upon this topic when we heard a footstep approaching us and looking up saw mr boyer within a few paces of the arbor confusion seized us both we rose involuntarily from our seats but were mute as statues he spoke not a word but casting a look of indignant accusation at me a glance which penetrated my very soul turned on his heel and walked hastily back to the house i stood a few moments considering what course to take though shame and regret had almost taken from me the power of thought major sanford took my hand i withdrew it from him i must leave you said i where will you go said he i will go and try to retrieve my character it has suffered greatly by this fatal interview he threw himself at my feet and exclaimed leave me not eliza i conjure you not to leave me let me go now i rejoined or i bid you farewell forever i flew precipitately by him and went into the parlor where i found mr boyer and my mamma the one traversing the room in the greatest agitation the other in a flood of tears their appearance affected me and i wept like an infant when i had a little recovered myself i begged him to sit down he answered no i then told him that however unjustifiable my conduct might appear perhaps i might explain it to his satisfaction if he would hear me that my motives were innocent though they doubtless wore the aspect of criminality in his view he sternly replied that no palliation could avail that my motives were sufficiently notorious he accused me of treating him ill of rendering him the dupe of coquetting artifice of having an intrigue with major sanford and declared his determination to leave me forever as unworthy of his regard and incapable of love gratitude or honor there was too much reason in support of his accusations for me to gainsay them had his impetuosity suffered me to attempt it but in truth i had no inclination to self defence my natural vivacity had forsaken me and i listened without interrupting him to the fluency of reproachful language which his resentment inspired he took a very solemn and affectionate leave of my mamma thanking her for her politeness and wishing her much future felicity he attempted to address me i suppose somewhat in the same way but his sensibility somewhat overcame him and he only took my hand and bowing in silence departed the want of rest for two long nights together the exercise of mind and conflict of passions which now tortured my breast were too much for me to support when i saw that he was gone that he had actually forsaken me i fainted my mamma with the assistance of the maid soon restored me when i opened my eyes and beheld this amiable and tender parent watching and attending me with the most anxious concern without one reproachful word without one accusing look my reflections upon the part i had acted in defeating her benevolent wishes were exquisitely afflictive but we mutually forbore to mention the occasion of my illness and i complied with her advice to take some refreshment and retire to my chamber i am so much fatigued by the exertions of the day that rest is absolutely necessary and i lay aside my pen to seek it friday morning when i shall again receive the balmy influence of sleep i know not it has absolutely forsaken me at present i have had a most restless night every awakening idea presented itself to my imagination whether i had sustained a real loss in mr boyer s departure reflections on my own misconduct with the censure of my friends and the ill natured remarks of my enemies excited the most painful anxiety in my mind i am going down but how shall i see my mamma to her i will confess my faults in her maternal breast repose my cares and by her friendly advice regulate my conduct had i done this before i might have escaped this trouble and saved both her and myself many distressing emotions friday evening i have had a long conversation with my mamma which has greatly relieved my mind she has soothed me with the most endearing tenderness mr atkins with whom mr boyer lodged while in town called here this afternoon i did not see him but he told my mamma that mr boyer had returned home and left a letter for me which he had promised to convey with his own hand by this i am convinced that the die is absolutely cast with respect to him and that no attempts on my part to bring about a reconciliation would be either prudent or successful he has penetrated the cause of my proceedings and such is his resentment that i am inclined not much to regret his avoiding another interview my excuses would be deemed utterly insufficient and truth would not befriend and justify me as i know you are impatient to hear from me i will now despatch this long letter without any other addition than that i am your sincere friend eliza wharton letter xlii to mr charles deighton hartford well charles the show is over as we yankees say and the
time to be visible only by fits this token of approaching land affected me as much as if i had reached the threshhold of my friend s dwelling at length we entered the port and i viewed with high raised but inexplicable feelings objects with which i had been from infancy familiar the flag staff erected on the battery recalled to my imagination the pleasures of the evening and morning walks which i had taken on that spot with the lost constantia the dream was fondly cherished that the figure which i saw loitering along the terrace was her s on disembarking i gazed at every female passenger in hope that it was she whom i sought an absence of three years had obliterated from my memory none of the images which attended me on my departure chapter xxiv after a night of repose rather than of sleep i began the search after my friend i went to the house which the dudleys formerly inhabited and which had been the asylum of my infancy it was now occupied by strangers by whom no account could be given of its former tenants i obtained directions to the owner of the house he was equally unable to satisfy my curiosity the purchase had been made at a public sale and terms had been settled not with dudley but with the sheriff it is needless to say that the history of craig s imposture and its consequences were confirmed by every one who resided at that period in new york the dudleys were well remembered and their disappearance immediately after their fall had been generally noticed but whither they had retired was a problem which no one was able to solve this evasion was strange by what motives the dudleys were induced to change their ancient abode could be vaguely guessed my friend s grandfather was a native of the west indies descendants of the same stock still resided in tobago they might be affluent and to them it was possible that mr dudley in this change of fortune had betaken himself for relief this was a mournful expedient since it would raise a barrier between my friend and myself scarcely to be surmounted constantia s mother was stolen by mr dudley from a convent at amiens there were no affinities therefore to draw them to france her grandmother was a native of baltimore of a family of some note by name ridgeley this family might still exist and have either afforded an asylum to the dudleys or at least be apprised of their destiny it was obvious to conclude that they no longer existed within the precincts of new york a journey to baltimore was the next expedient this journey was made in the depth of winter and by the speediest conveyance i made no more than a day s sojourn in philadelphia the epidemic by which that city had been lately ravaged i had not heard of till my arrival in america its devastations were then painted to my fancy in the most formidable colours a few months only had elapsed since its extinction and i expected to see numerous marks of misery and dispopulation to my no small surprize however no vestiges of this calamity were to be discerned all houses were open all streets thronged and all faces thoughtless or busy the arts and the amusements of life seemed as sedulously cultivated as ever little did i then think what had been and what at that moment was the condition of my friend i stopt for the sake of respite from fatigue and did not therefore pass much time in the streets perhaps had i walked seasonably abroad we might have encountered each other and thus have saved ourselves from a thousand anxieties at baltimore i made myself known without the formality of introduction to the ridgeleys they acknowledged their relationship to mr dudley but professed absolute ignorance of his fate indirect intercourse only had been maintained formerly by dudley with his mother s kindred they had heard of his misfortune a twelvemonth after it happened but what measures had been subsequently pursued their kinsman had not thought proper to inform them the failure of this expedient almost bereft me of hope neither my own imagination nor the ridgeleys could suggest any new mode by which my purpose was likely to be accomplished to leave america without obtaining the end of my visit could not be thought of without agony and yet the continuance of my stay promised me no relief from my uncertainties on this theme i ruminated without ceasing i recalled every conversation and incident of former times and sought in them a clue by which my present conjectures might be guided one night immersed alone in my chamber my thoughts were thus employed my train of meditation was on this occasion new from the review of particulars from which no satisfaction had hitherto been gained i passed to a vague and comprehensive retrospect mr dudley s early life his profession of a painter his zeal in this pursuit and his reluctance to quit it were remembered would he not revert to this profession when other means of subsistence were gone it is true similar obstacles with those which had formerly occasioned his resort to a different path existed at present and no painter of his name was to be found in philadelphia baltimore or new york but would it not occur to him that the patronage denied to his skill by the frugal and unpolished habits of his countrymen might with more probability of success be sought from the opulence and luxury of london nay had he not once affirmed in my hearing that if he ever were reduced to poverty this was the method he would pursue this conjecture was too bewitching to be easily dismissed every new reflection augmented its force i was suddenly raised by it from the deepest melancholy to the region
